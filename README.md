# STA426
![Nice collection of packages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/tidyverse/master/man/figures/logo.png)

Public repo for STA426 at University of Zurich in Fall 2020.

## Course material
All official course material can be found on the [official repo](https://github.com/sta426hs2020/) while [this repo](https://github.com/slightlier/STA426) will track only personal assignments.

## Misc
Luckily, Github flavored MD also supports $\LaTeX$ and `print("inline code")`, so we have everything we need for documentation! For syntax highlighting however, we need to use codeblocks:

```R
library(bioconductor)
library(tidyverse)
```

```py
import lifelines
import pystan
```
